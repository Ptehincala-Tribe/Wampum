JavaScript RPC communication with the Ethereum network.

Usage
-----

ethrpc can be installed using npm:
```
$ npm install ethrpc
```
After installing, to use it with Node, just require it:
```javascript
var rpc = require("ethrpc");
```
A minified, browserified file `dist/ethrpc.min.js` is included for use in the browser.  Including this file simply attaches an `ethrpc` object to `window`:
```html
<script src="dist/ethrpc.min.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
```

### Basic RPC

The `raw` method allows you to send in commands that won't be parsed/mangled by ethrpc.  (Similar to sending RPC requests with cURL.)

```
rpc.raw("net_peerCount");
"0x10"

rpc.eth("gasPrice");
"0x015f90"
```
Many commonly used functions have named wrappers.  For example, `blockNumber` fetches the current block number:

```javascript
rpc.blockNumber();
217153
```

### Contract upload and download

`publish` broadcasts (uploads) a compiled contract to the network, and returns the contract's address:

```javascript
var address = rpc.publish("0x603980600b6000396044567c01000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006000350463643ceff9811415603757600a60405260206040f35b505b6000f3");
// address:
"0xf4549459f9ef8c8898c054a7fc37c286831c2ced"
```

`read` downloads code from a contract already on the Ethereum network:

```javascript
var evm = rpc.read("0x5204f18c652d1c31c6a5968cb65e011915285a50");
// evm:
"0x7c010000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000060003504636ffa1caa81141560415760043560405260026040510260605260206060f35b50"
```

### Contract methods: call and sendTransaction

The `invoke` method executes a method in a contract already on the network.  It can broadcast transactions to the network and/or capture return values by calling the contract method(s) locally.
```javascript
// The method called here doubles its input argument.
rpc.invoke({
   to: "0x5204f18c652d1c31c6a5968cb65e011915285a50",
   method: "double",
   signature: "i",
   params: 22121, // parameter value(s)
   send: false,
   returns: "number"
});
// returns:
44242
```
Transaction fields are as follows:

Required:

- to: `<contract address> (hexstring)`
- method: `<function name> (string)`
- signature: `<function signature, e.g. "iia"> (string)`
- params: `<parameters passed to the function>`

Optional:

- send: `<true to sendTransaction, false to call (default)>`
- from: `<sender's address> (hexstring; defaults to the coinbase account)`
- returns: `<"array", "int", "BigNumber", or "string" (default)>`

The `params` and `signature` fields are required if your function accepts parameters; otherwise, these fields can be excluded.  The `returns` field is used only to format the output, and does not affect the actual RPC request.

`invoke` currently only works for [Serpent](https://github.com/ethereum/serpent) contracts.  The extra datatypes included by [Solidity](https://github.com/ethereum/solidity) are not (yet) supported by the [augur-abi](https://github.com/AugurProject/augur-abi) encoder.  The augur-abi encoder requires all parameters to be type `string`, `int256`, or `int256[]`.

Tests
-----

Unit tests are included in `test/ethrpc.js`, and can be run using npm:
```
$ npm test
```

Alternatively, you can run the tests inside of a docker container.  Docker layer caching is leveraged to make it so the build is very fast after the first time (unless you change dependencies):
```
docker build -t ethrpc . && docker run --rm ethrpc
```
